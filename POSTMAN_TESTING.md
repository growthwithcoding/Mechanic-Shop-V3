```json
{
  "message": "Part successfully added to ticket",
  "ticket_id": 1,
  "part_id": 1,
  "part_name": "Brake Pad Set - Premium",
  "quantity_used": 1,
  "unit_cost_cents": 4800,

## üéì Additional Testing Exercises

### Exercise 1: Test Authentication Flow
1. Create a second customer
2. Login as second customer
3. Try to update first customer's info
4. **Expected**: Should get `403 Forbidden` (users can only update themselves)

### Exercise 2: Test Rate Limiting
1. Try registering 4 times in one hour
2. **Expected**: 4th attempt should fail with `429 Too Many Requests`
3. Try logging in 6 times rapidly
4. **Expected**: 6th attempt should fail

### Exercise 3: Test Caching
1. Run "GET All Mechanics" and note response time
2. Wait 1 minute and run again - should be instant (cached)
3. Update a mechanic
4. Run "GET All Mechanics" again - cache should still be active
5. Wait 5 minutes and run again - fresh data loaded

### Exercise 4: Test Pagination
1. Create multiple customers (you'd need to modify the collection)
2. Test: `GET /customers?page=1&per_page=5`
3. Test: `GET /customers?page=2&per_page=5`
4. Verify pagination metadata is correct

### Exercise 5: Test Inventory Workflow
1. Create a part with 10 items in stock and reorder level of 8
2. Add the part to a ticket 3 times (use different quantities)
3. Check remaining stock - should be decremented
4. Run "GET Low Stock Parts" - your part should appear
5. Adjust quantity back up
6. Verify it's no longer in low stock list

### Exercise 6: Test Mechanic Activity Sorting
1. Assign Mechanic 1 to 3 different tickets
2. Assign Mechanic 2 to 1 ticket
3. Run "GET Mechanics by Activity"
4. **Expected**: Mechanic 1 should be listed first (more tickets)

### Exercise 7: Test Bulk Operations
1. Create 3 mechanics
2. Create 1 service ticket
3. Use Bulk Edit to add all 3 mechanics at once
4. Verify all 3 are assigned
5. Use Bulk Edit to remove 2 mechanics
6. Verify only 1 remains

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "401 Unauthorized" errors
**Solution**: 
- Your JWT token may have expired (1 hour expiration)
- Run "Login Customer" again to get a fresh token
- Check that the environment is selected (top-right dropdown)

### Problem: "404 Not Found" errors
**Solution**:
- Check that the API server is running (`python app.py`)
- Verify the base_url in environment is `http://localhost:5000`
- Ensure you've run prerequisite tests (e.g., create vehicle before creating ticket)

### Problem: Environment variables not saving
**Solution**:
- Check the "Tests" tab in each request - scripts should be present
- Ensure correct environment is selected
- Try re-importing the environment file

### Problem: "Rate limit exceeded" errors
**Solution**:
- This is expected! It means rate limiting is working
- Wait for the time period to reset (check error message)
- For testing, you can temporarily disable rate limiting in the code

### Problem: Foreign key constraint errors
**Solution**:
- Ensure you create resources in the correct order:
  1. Customer (via registration)
  2. Vehicle (requires customer_id)
  3. Mechanic
  4. Service Ticket (requires vehicle_id and customer_id)
  5. Assign mechanics to tickets
  6. Add parts to tickets
